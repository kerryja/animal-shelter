      <h3>Introducing Your New Dog to Resident Dog(s)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>
            Remove all bones, toys, and food before the new pup arrives.
          </span>{" "}
          The best way to start off introductions is to remove anything that
          they might fight over. It is not unusual for dogs to compete for
          resources when forced to live in a “pack” situation. Save the bones
          and special toys for when they’re safely in their crates or at least
          in a separate area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Make introductions brief.</span> Introductions should be brief.
          If they sniff and then ignore, give them a little more time and don’t
          force the issue. Brief introductions followed by having them separate
          is a good way to avoid stressful situations. You can then slowly
          increase the amount of time together. Do not let a young puppy jump
          all over your older dog, so keep intros brief. If your dog is stressed
          it might be wise to briefly crate the new dog. The best way to
          introduce inside is to bring your dogs outside and bring the new dog
          inside. Then let your dogs in. That will lessen the chances of your
          dogs feeling protective. It’s wise to keep leashes on until you’re
          sure the dogs are getting along. Again, keep the meeting short.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Be conservative.</span> Don’t leave the dogs to play unattended,
          even if it looks as if everything is going well. Play is arousing and
          high arousal can lead to out of control emotions which can lead to
          aggression. It’s very similar to children on a playground. It’s often
          the smaller dogs who get picked on so make sure you pick your play
          group appropriately.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Feed separately.</span> Feeding should be enjoyable and
          stress-free. Always feed visiting dogs separately, either in their
          crate away from your dogs, or in another room. Make sure all food is
          removed before putting them together in a group again. Even the best
          of friends in the dog world can fight over food.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Allow for a transition period.</span> The most successful
          multiple dog households allow the dogs to get used to one another
          gradually. Let them have several brief introductions over a 2-3-day
          period, often longer. As volunteers, we have fostered many dogs
          successfully by letting our pack get used to the new dog slowly. The
          person with the most patience often has the greatest success. It’s
          always best to crate the new pup and let your dog get used to his
          smells without being jumped on or feeling like his territory is
          infringed upon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>When the honeymoon is over.</span> In some situations, the dogs
          will hit if off beautifully, but after a few weeks the trouble begins
          when the new dog decides to move up in status. Often it is the
          younger, more insecure dog who will try this maneuver. If you have a
          dominant dog, he or she will correct the new dog. This is okay. It may
          take a few times for the new dog to take the correction. Sometimes the
          new dog will eventually move up and your resident dogs will give in.
          This is okay too. If you find yourself constantly breaking up fights,
          then you should call us for help. The reason we’re so careful in our
          placements with other dogs is to prevent an adoption disruption,
          especially after you’ve grown attached to the dog. Same sex dogs of
          equal size and breed often have the most trouble because it’s hard for
          them to figure out where they belong in the pack. Whatever you do,
          don’t try to break up a dog fight by reaching in near the dog’s face
          or neck. If you are outside you can spray with the house and inside
          try yelling, clapping hands, spaying with a squirt bottle, or even
          grabbing the rear legs of the dog.

      <h3>Introducing Your New Dog or Pup to the Family Cat</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If you are bringing home a new dog or puppy into your household,
          introductions with any resident pets should be approached slowly. If
          you have a cat or kitten, please do not introduce the pets on the
          floor but have the cat out of reach of the dog. It's best to have one
          of the pets in a crate and let the other pet walk by. If the new dog
          becomes fixated or begins to salivate then you will need to keep them
          separate and consult a trainer to ensure the safety of both pets. This
          is not only for the safety of your cat, but for the safety of the new
          dog or puppy as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          One must never just bring a new dog or puppy into the household and
          assume that the dog and cat will "work it out" in their own way and in
          their own time. That is true up to a point. However, it is very
          important that one brings the new dog or puppy into the house on a
          leash and makes that initial introduction with considerable
          supervision, alertness, and preparedness for any sort of negative
          response on the part of either animal.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have had dogs in foster homes that have done well with resident
          cats, come nose to nose with them, and had no fear. Given that
          experience, that same dog is going to logically assume that any cat is
          friendly. Most likely the dog will approach a new cat with curiosity,
          but also without due caution. If the family cat is not used to dogs,
          the chances of it taking a swipe with sharp claws is very possible.
          This can happen with even the most benign puppy or dog that has had
          only a good experience with cats in the foster home. If your cat has
          not lived with dogs and not seen dogs, it will be fearful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before bringing the new dog home, make a point of clipping your cat's
          nails. If the cat does take a swipe, a dull nail can mean the
          difference between serious and non-serious injury. Cats go for the
          eyes of any threatening animal out of fear and the need to protect
          themselves. In split seconds, a cat's nail can puncture the cornea of
          an unsuspecting dog or puppy. It is better to be safe than sorry.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most important thing is that the resident cat knows there is a new
          member of the family. By introducing the new dog or puppy on a leash
          to the cat, and keeping the dog at a reasonable distance, one is
          playing it safe for everyone. The cat needs to see the dog, know it
          will be in the home, but on first sight, not have nose to nose
          contact. Never just allow the dog to walk up to your cat on its first
          contact. Some cats will hide, and some will protest by not using the
          litter box. In most cases it can take one to three weeks for a cat to
          accept a new pet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes these formal introductions must be made over and over, if
          one suspects the cat might become agitated. On leash, allow the dog to
          move slowly up to the cat while the cat is elevated on a counter or
          something high. The cat needs to sense that curiosity, not aggression,
          is the motive behind the interest. After a while, the cat will realize
          the dog is not going to hurt it. Puppies are particularly at risk for
          eye injuries as their reactions are not as quick as an adult dog.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conversely, one may have a new dog that is not used to cats. The dog
          may be overbearing in its curiosity and may be too rough. It may want
          to chase. This will take patience to do a lot of "on leash"
          introductions. The goal is to get the dog to say "Ok, that small fry
          lives here too, and it's no big deal – I guess I don't have to chase
          it."
        </li>
        <li>
          No matter what experience a dog has had with cats in its former foster
          or original home, always take the safe approach. Never assume. Walking
          in the door for the first time, have your new dog on leash. Place your
          cat in a room where it cannot leave. Let it see the new dog. Make sure
          the dog sees it. Keep the dog on leash and be sure it does make eye
          contact with the cat. Then let each approach one another, keeping some
          distance between them. Take your time. Do not rush the introduction.
          If you sense any concern that the cat might hurt the dog, or the dog
          hurt the cat, make the introductions formal and on leash for several
          days, until some understanding is reached between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once a cat senses a dog is not going to hurt it, it most often does
          not attack with its claws. But this comes with a lot of safe
          introductions in the beginning. Never consider de-clawing a cat to
          avoid eye injuries to your dog! De-clawing is a painful and
          unnecessary approach and it is not endorsed by most vets or humane
          organizations due to its disfiguring and negative consequences. If you
          truly feel the dog may hurt the cat, or the cat hurt the dog, please
          keep them separate, and call us to discuss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please do not leave dogs and cats alone together unsupervised for at
          least the first six months that the dog is in the home. It's always
          better to err on the side of safety than to put your pets at risk.{" "}
