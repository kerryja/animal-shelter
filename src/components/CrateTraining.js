      <h3>Basics</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The purpose of crating a young dog or pup is to keep him safe while
          you cannot directly supervise him and to teach him to control his
          bladder and bowels. This is best done in a confined area and we've
          found that the crate is perfect for this. Be sure the area is not
          larger than 2x the length of your dog's body and that it's just tall
          enough for him to stand up. He will need to be in the crate long
          enough to have to go. Because he's in a small space he won't want to
          mess up his "den" so he will wait. You can put an old towel or blanket
          in with him and a chew toy to keep him occupied. If you have a wire
          crate, it's best to remove any collars that have tags as they can get
          caught in the bars of the crate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have the crate in your view or in an area where the family members
          are. If he fusses too much you may have to move him to another room
          until he quiets down. Don't reward barking in the crate with attention
          as that will reinforce the barking. When he stops barking, then go see
          how he's doing and give him a treat or some reassurance. For a
          3-month-old pup you should have him in the crate at least an hour but
          not more than 3 hours at a time, if possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          As soon as you get him out of the crate, take him outside to a
          selected area. Don't take him for a walk as all the smells will be too
          distracting, but just stay in one spot and let him pace in an area 5
          to 10 feet. The pacing will get things moving and once he's smelled
          all the smells in that area he'll most likely go. When he goes, praise
          him or if you're using a clicker, click at the end of the bowel
          movement and then give him a juicy treat.
        </li>
        <li>
          After he goes and he's back inside, you can play with him or let him
          play alone in a confined area no larger than a bathroom or mudroom,
          for about 20-30 minutes. Then put him back in the crate so he can
          build up enough time to have to go again. Let him have water as this
          will speed the process. If he whines and paces, that may be a good
          indicator that it's time. As you crate your dog longer and longer you
          will learn how long he can hold it, but also it will strengthen his
          bladder so that he can hold it longer. Remember, no longer than a 3 or
          4 hour stretch for young pup. You want to set him up for success, so
          don't wait too long.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you take him outside and he doesn't go after about 3 or 4 minutes,
          then take him back in and put him right into the crate. Then take him
          out in one-hour intervals. Each time he doesn't go, he goes back into
          the crate. This is not punishment, but you'll need to confine him
          until he learns to hold it and only "go" outside. By letting him have
          a playtime after each urination or bowel movement he will also get the
          message that there are rewards for going outside. Each time he has a
          success let him play in the confined area a longer period. You may
          find that in just a few daysâ€™ time he will be holding it longer and
          longer and when you take him out he will do his business sooner and
          sooner as he gets the message about what's expected. Remember not to
          play with him when you go out but let him be bored enough to do his
          business.
        </li>
        <li>
          If he has accidents inside, don't scold him. He won't understand but
          even worse he may associate going to the bathroom in front of you as a
          bad thing and that could lead to problems with getting him to go while
          on leash (because he won't want to get punished). If he's having
          accidents, then he needs less free play time and more crate time until
          you get him back on a schedule.
        </li>

      <h4>Crating at Night</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It's crucial that your new pup be crated at night and preferably{" "}
          <span>not</span> have the crate in your bedroom. Take him outside just
          before bedtime and then put him in his crate with a soft blanket or
          towel.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol className={styles.list_style}>
        <li>
          First thing in the morning, take the pup outside to go to the
          bathroom. Give lots of praise when he goes, and promptly bring him in
          for breakfast.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feed your puppy in the crate, if possible, as it gives him a
          pleasurable experience while in the crate. Within 10-20 minutes take
          him outside again as he will often need a bowel movement shortly after
          eating.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should allow your puppy to eat until full, then pick up the bowl
          and do not allow him to free feed. The reason is that you want him on
          a schedule so that he will not have unexpected bowel movements. Dogs
          who eat all day tend to go all day and house training is not as easy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once he's had a bowel movement, praise him and bring him in to play.
          He should be good for another 30 minutes or so.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you cannot supervise him, you should put him in the crate with a
          chew toy to keep him busy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Puppies can generally "hold it" for an hour or two, so when the hour
          is up, take him out again and praise him when he goes.
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll want to take him out before you retire for the night and then
          again first thing the next morning. Crating at night will help teach
          your pup to hold it through the night. If he whines in the middle of
          the night, it may mean that he has to go. Most pups over 8 weeks can
          make it through the night without incident, depending on the size of
          the dog, the larger the better for ability to hold it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your pup may make mistakes in the beginning, but once he realizes that
          he's going to get out of the crate for lots of pee and play time, then
          he will learn to hold it longer and longer. As he's allowed more free
          play time, leave the crate door open so he will be accustomed to going
          in and out of his little den. Even after he's outgrown the use of the
          crate, it's a great tool to have for trips or for when you need to
          isolate him (example, when carpenters or cleaning people who are apt
          to leave doors ajar are at your house). Remember, the crate is a tool
          and the more consistent you are in the beginning, the greater success
          you will have in the end.
